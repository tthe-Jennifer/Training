    <div class="quote"><em>As Achebe said, “If you don’t like someone’s story, you tell your own.” And Africans should not wait for tributes to their heroes to be told by others, as encapsulated in Achebe’s memorable proverb:“If nobody will praise me, I will praise myself, said the Lizard which fell from the high Iroko tree.” Many would have witnessed that the lizard, on falling, nods its head repeatedly in appreciation of its feat.</em></div>
